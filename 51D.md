## Enable debugging of NuGet packages

In order to debug into NuGet packages, you must be using packages that reference debug symbols. By default, this includes all pre-release packages but not final versions.
If you have a debuggable package then you will need to configure Visual Studio to allow you to step into it:

- In tools -> options -> debugging -> symbols, add the Azure DevOps symbol server:

- Select the ‘Load only specified modules’ option at the bottom and configure it to only load Symbols for 51Degrees modules as shown below:

- In tools -> options -> debugging -> general, ensure that:
  - Enable Just My Code is off. Having this on will prevent VS stepping into any NuGet packages.
  - Enable source server support is on.
  - Example Source Link support is on.

When stepping into a method from a relevant NuGet package, you should now see the following warning message:
