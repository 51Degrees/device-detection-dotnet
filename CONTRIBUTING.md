# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this project, please see the shared 51Degrees

## Considerations

When new projects are added, be sure to update the `.slnf` file too.
This is a solution filter which loads only dotnet core projects, and
can be used to build on platforms like Linux which do not have support
for Framework.
